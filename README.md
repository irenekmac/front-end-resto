## Introduction

A web app created for when two (or more) people canâ€™t decide where to eat. Users can add restaurants they like or want to check out and the web app chooses one at random.

Feel free to test out my app [here](https://irenekmac.github.io/front-end-resto/).

## Motivation

The aim of this project was to:

* Learn React

* Work with APIs and how to call on the data
* Use Gmaps API

This was my last project at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course at Sydney.
